 This capstone project comprises of two sub-projects which are as follows:
 
 Healthcare: Here, I am expected to bild a model which is able to predict accurately whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset using  Descriptive analysis, classification algorithm and KNN algorithm.
 
Real Estate: Here I am expected to create a statistical model needs to be created to predict the potential demand in dollars amount of loan for each of the region in the USA, using EDA and linear Regression model.
